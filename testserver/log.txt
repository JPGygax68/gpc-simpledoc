I find myself in danger of getting overwhelmed/demotivated again. So, I need to find the most logical and effective next baby step to keep the momentum going.

Problem right now: documents have no names and/or titles

-> method to get "tagline" ?
-> is it good/ok to have a document data type that *needs* method (makes serializing/deserializing more complicated)
-> what's the status right now?
-> don't have de-serializing yet -> decision-making time
   - Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, proto) can help
   - is there a library to help with this? 
     -> Yes, resurrect-js
  -> on the whole, I think "dumb" data structures are superior in this case

(Keeping a separate log for the test server, as it will likely become a real server pretty soon.)

- Stylus middleware puts compiled .css files into same folder as .styl files. Better solution ?
